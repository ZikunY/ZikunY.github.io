I have served as a teaching assistant for a variety of statistics courses at Indiana University, within the Department of Statistics. My experience spans from large undergraduate courses with over one hundred students to graduate-level courses with a strong focus on statistical theory. In total, I have contributed to the preparation and teaching of nine distinct courses.
